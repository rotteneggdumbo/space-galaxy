<center><h1> The Universe </h1> </center>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> The Universe includes all of space and all the matter and energy that space contains.
 Our solar system is only a very small part of the whole universe.
 The universe is possibly infinite.
 Scientists think that the universe is still expanding.
 The visible universe is at least 93 light years across.
 Scientists believe that the Universe was born above 13.8 billion years ago with a Big Bang.
 The scientific study of the universe is called astronomy. </p>
<br>
<h2> The Big Bang </h2>

<p>The Big Bang was when the universe burst into existence from a single dense point.
 It happened about 13.8 billion years ago.
 The temperature at one second after the Big Bang was about ten billion degrees Fahrenheit.
 Hydrogen and Helium were the only elements at the beginning of the universe.
 We know the Big Bang happened because astronomers made several observations of the expansion of the universe, cosmic microwave background radiation and the age of the oldest known stars.
 The cosmic background explorer, a NASA satellite, made an accurate map of the radiation left over from the Big Bang.
 The map showed the lumpiness of the early universe.
 Today the universe is still expanding. </p>
<br>
<h2> Galaxies and the Milky Way </h2>

<p>A galaxy is a collection of stars, gas, and dust held together by gravity.
 Galaxies form when cold dark matter starts clumping together and attracts more matter.
 About two hundred billion galaxies exist in the observable universe.
 The four types of galaxies are spiral, barred spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies.
 The Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy, includes our solar system.
 Earth is about halfway between the center of the Milky Way and its outer edge.
 A galactic year, the time it takes for our solar system to orbit the Milky Way, is about 230 million years.
 The galaxy is so large that a space probe would take two billion years to cross the Milky Way.</p>
<br>
<h2> Stars </h2>

<p>Stars, huge fiery balls of gas, live for millions of years.
 They form when large clouds of dust and gas get pulled by gravity and the gasses get hot enough for nuclear reactions.
 Stars shine because they are burning.There are trillions of stars scattered through the universe.
 Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky.
 Astronomers classify stars based on their size, color, and brightness.
 The bigger the start the shorter it lives.
 They twinkle because of movements in the Earth's atmosphere.
 When a star runs out of hydrogen the outer layers explode leading to the end of the star's life.</p>
<br>
<h2> Terrestrial Planets </h2>

<p>Terrestrial planets, the four closest planets to the sun, are Mercury,Venus, Earth, and Mars.
 They are small, dense, and rocky. Mercury is the smallest terestrial planet while Earth is the largest.
 The presence of life on Earth and the abundance of oxygen in its atmosphere makes it unique.
 No other planet is proven to have life.
 Venus’s surface temperature reaches up to 864℉ making it the hottest planet in the solar system.
 It shines like a brilliant jewel in space.
 Venus looks so bright because its thick clouds reflect sunlight.
 It can be best seen before sunrise in the eastern sky and before sunset in the western sky.
 Mars, the red planet, gets its distinctive color from iron oxide in its soil.
 NASA’s Curiosity rover has been studying martian soil since 2012.</p>
<br>
<h2> Gas Planets</h2>

<p> Gas planets namely Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are also called gas giants.
 They are large, surrounded by rings, have multiple moons, and made mostly of gasses.
 Their core is rocky. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system.
 Some people thought if Jupiter was a little bit bigger, nuclear fires deep inside it would radiate heat just like the Sun.
 So they called it a failed star. Saturn can float on water because it is less dense than water.
 Liquid methane in their oceans makes Neptune and Uranus look blue.
 All four gas planets have rings, but we can only see Saturn’s rings through a telescope from Earth.</p>
<br>
<h2> Dwarf Planets </h2>

<p> Dwarf planets are worlds too small to be considered regular planets. The best known dwarf planets include Eris, Pluto, Haumea, and Ceres.
 There are likely many more dwarf planets to be discovered in the Kuiper belt.
 Ceres is the only known dwarf planet not located in the Cuiper belt, and is in the Asteroid Belt.
 Pluto, the largest known dwarf planet measures 1473 miles across.
 Pluto takes 248 Earth years to orbit the Sun. One day on Pluto is 153 hours.
 NASA spacecraft, New Horizons and Dawn flew close to the dwarf planets.
 New Horizons was launched in 2006 as a part of NASA's New Frontiers program.
 It did a flyby study of Pluto and its moons in 2015.</p>
<br>
<h2> Moons </h2>

<p> Moons, natural satellites, come in many shapes and sizes.
 There are over 200 moons in our solar system. Saturn has the most moons at 82.
 Venus and Mercury don't have any moons.  Jupiter has the biggest moon named Ganymede.
 It is bigger than the planet Mercury. Mars has the smallest moon named Deimos.
 Dwarf planets and many asteroids also have moons. The natural satellite of Earth is called the Moon.
 It has mountains, craters and seas.
 The moon does not produce its own light but it reflects light from the sun.</p>
<br>
<h2> Asteroids, Comets and Meteoroids </h2> 

<p>Asteroids, comets, and meteoroids are small bodies that are leftovers from the formation of our solar system.
 Asteroids, Rocky and small objects that orbit the sun, range in size from 33 to 329 miles.
 The current number of known asteroids is 1,113,527. Comets, large objects made with dust and ice, orbit the Sun.
 The nucleus of a comet contains icy chunks Frozen gasses and bits of embedded dust.
 The current number of comets known is 3,743. 
A meteoroid is a space rock that enters Earth's atmosphere or another planet's atmosphere.
 If a meteoroid burns up the Atmosphere it is called a meteor and if it hits the ground it is called a meteorite. </p>
<br>
<h2> Exoplanets </h2>

<p> Exoplanets, planets that orbit around stars that aren't the sun, are made of elements that are similar to other planets but in different mixes.
 They are also called extrasolar planets because they are outside of the solar system.
 The closest known exoplanet to Earth is four light years away.
 Exoplanets vary in size.
 They can be bigger than Jupiter or smaller than Mercury.
 They can be boiling hot or freezing cold.
 In 2009 NASA launched the Kepler space telescope.
 When thousands of new exoplanets came into view.
 So far NASA has confirmed 5211 exoplanets. </p>
<br>
<h2> Exploring Space </h2>
<p> We explore space to better understand the universe and especially our solar system.
 Yuri Gagarin, a cosmonaut, was the first person to go into space.
 Telescopes, space probes, and spacecrafts help us explore space.
 A space station is an artificial satellite built by humans and launched into orbit where astronauts can live and work while in space.
 The Soviet Union’s  Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth.
 It took 96.2 minutes to complete each orbit.
 Sputnik 1 traveled in an elliptical orbit for three months and then it burned up in Earth's atmosphere.
 NASA operated a reusable spacecraft known as a space shuttle from 1981 to 2011.
 It retired due to safety concerns.
